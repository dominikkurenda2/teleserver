# Install
In order to install teleserver clone project repo from github.
Afterwards, cd into project directory.

In order to install teleserver run script:
```

```

After reboot or session restart, all you need to do is find IP address of your machine (for example with `ip a`).

The server is configured to start at the beginning of user sesison.

**NOTE** Teleserver uses https, so in case of unrecognised address please add `https://` before address.

**NOTE** Teleserver uses self-signed ssl certificate. In case of warning from web browser just click Advanced option and continue to website.

## Login feature

By default teleserver can be reached by anyone,
However, if you want to set password and login for GUI run this script:
```
/var/lib/teleserver/set_login_credentials.py
```

You'll be asked for login and password which later should be used for login on GUI.

[*If you didn't set login credentials and you are prompted for login ju≈º apply without entering any credentials.*]

# How to use it?

Firstly, you need IP of your machine.
When you get it then all the 'commands' will begin with
```
<IP address>:8080
```
where 8080 is a port that machine's server operates on.
